## ⭐ What “Behavior‑Driven Gherkin” Means
**Gherkin is a plain‑English, structured language used to describe software behavior without writing code.**

- It’s the language used in BDD (Behavior‑Driven Development) to express:
- what the system should do
- how it should behave
- how a user interacts with it
- what outcomes are expected
**Gherkin** is readable by humans and executable by test frameworks like Cucumber, Behave, SpecFlow, etc.

## ⭐ The Core Idea
- Gherkin turns requirements into executable examples.
### Instead of writing:

`“The login page should validate credentials.”`

### You write:

Code
```
Feature: Login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter valid credentials
    Then they should be redirected to the dashboard
```

### This is both:
- a requirement
- a test
- a shared understanding between devs, PMs, QA, and stakeholders

## ⭐ Why It’s Called Behavior‑Driven

### Because it focuses on:
- behavior, not implementation
- examples, not abstract rules
- outcomes, not internal logic

#### BDD + Gherkin = “describe the behavior first, then build it.”

## ⭐ The Gherkin Keywords (the whole language)
### Feature
**What capability are we describing?**

### Scenario
**One example of how the feature behaves.**

### Given
**The starting state.**

### When
**The action the user or system takes.**

### Then
**The expected outcome.**

### And / But
**Additional steps.**

That’s it.
The entire language is intentionally tiny.

## ⭐ Why Agent Developers (like you) Should Care

### Gherkin is PERFECT for:
- describing agent tools
- defining agent behaviors
- writing acceptance criteria
- writing TDD/BDD specs
- defining breakpoints and HITL flows
- describing multi‑agent interactions
- documenting workflows in a way Antigravity can parse
You can literally describe an agent tool in Gherkin and let the IDE generate the plan.

## ⭐ A Gherkin Example for an Agent Tool
Code
```
Feature: Award loyalty points

  Scenario: Award points after a successful purchase
    Given a user has completed a purchase
    When the agent receives the purchase confirmation
    Then the agent should add loyalty points to the user's account
    And the updated balance should be stored in the memory store
```
This is exactly what your Antigravity TDD Planning Gate expects.
